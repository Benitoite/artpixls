## A(nother) RT

This is the repository of ART, a [free, open-source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html), cross-platform 
raw image processing program. 
ART is a derivative of the popular [RawTherapee](http://rawtherapee.com),
trading a bit of customization and control over various processing parameters for a simpler and (hopefully) easier to use interface,
while still maintaining the power and quality of RawTherapee.

For more information about ART, please visit [its webpage](https://art.pixls.us).
